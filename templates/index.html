          <h5>The Battle of the Titans</h5>
          <h5>Date:</h5>
          <p>2nd April, 85 AD</p>
          <p>A grand contest between two legendary gladiators, each hailed as 
            "The Titan" of their respective arenas. These two warriors, 
            Marius and Octavian, have fought across the empire, and their 
            final battle in the Colosseum was the most brutal yet. 
            The fight began as a one-on-one duel but escalated when a group of 
            armed gladiators were unleashed into the arena, turning it into a chaotic 
            battle royale. The event was accompanied by spectacular displays of Roman 
            war tactics and a final speech by the emperor, declaring Marius the victor, 
            a true hero of the empire.</p>

          <h5>The Great Beast Exhibition</h5>
          <h5>Date:</h5>
          <p>26th March, 85 AD</p>
          <p>The Colosseum hosted an extravagant animal hunt featuring exotic 
            creatures from the far reaches of the Roman Empire. The arena was filled 
            with lions, tigers, and elephants, as well as the more unusual beasts 
            like crocodiles and giraffes. Roman hunters and gladiators worked together 
            in teams to subdue the beasts, demonstrating their skills in both combat 
            and animal handling. The event was designed to show the might of the empire 
            and its control over the natural world, thrilling the crowd with close 
            encounters and daring hunts.</p>

          <h5>The Naval Battle of Alesia</h5>
          <h5>Date:</h5>
          <p>20th March, 85 AD</p>
          <p>In this extraordinary reenactment, the Colosseum was flooded to create 
            a mock naval battle between Roman forces and the Carthaginian fleet. 
            The Battle of Alesia was re-created on the water, with ships, rowers, 
            and sailors all acting out the conflict. Fireballs and flaming arrows 
            flew across the arena as mock sea battles unfolded, and Roman tactics were 
            displayed in full. The spectacle ended with the symbolic victory of Rome, 
            as the Roman ships closed in and "sank" the Carthaginian fleet. The event 
            was one of the most ambitious ever held in the Colosseum.</p>
